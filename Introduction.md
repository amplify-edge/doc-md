# Introduction

Welcome to Amplify Edge developers group.

https://github.com/amplify-edge

Amplify Edge is a software system founded by a team of developers and with many years experience in this field.
At the beginning we set up this group for chatting on developing our software system, then we saw that others can reuse the software for their own projects. It is good to share new projects in the software world.

Businesses, Organization, School or anyone that wants a system to communicate in an encrypted, real time way will find this useful.
We allow you to follow new technologies to achieve success and not to lag behind the progress in the digital world.

Follow us to take your company and team to the top, and of course, take advantage of the extraordinary blessings of technology.
Let's look at various practices together and share our views. Be prepared to be the first to experience our software, which we have been working on for a long time, and capture startup opportunities that others will never be able to access. Below we have shared notes to help you learn more about our Software - Pleasant Reading.

## Easy collaboration

The system can be run on your desktop or server and provides a Web GUI for your users to interact with.

The Security system is encrypted "end to end", ensuring security for all.

- Transport is encrypted with Https.
- Database is encrypted with your own password.

The "real time communications" base architecture is designed to support modern collaboration.

- as you edit something everyone else sees it.
- you cant edit offline ( maybe in future but not yet), but when you go online, it will synchronize with all others changes.

The system is designed as a PWA, which mean that when a user visits the web site, they can use the "add to home screen" popup to install it onto their Desktop or Mobile, and it feels and behaves exactly like an installed app from the Google and Apple app store. This is fantastic because oyu don't need to go through the apps store pains and costs..
